cryptic messages between levels:  (maybe: slightly melancholy things supposedly said by little purple guy)
"what do you think would be a fair reward?"
"do you enjoy following rules?"
"efficiency, above all else."
"'so rational a machine could do it'"
"would you believe me if I said I was a romantic?"
"it's what my parents did - and so on, to the next generation"
"I know you're only trying to help"

detect 'infinite loops' and getting stuck, but only mention them in this text ("always moving, never getting anywhere")

(music by Django Reinhardt - fits quite well, actually)
