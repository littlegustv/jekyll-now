### We've all heard this one, right?

*Thanks to Failbetter Games for all their lovely work.  Hope you enjoy!*

You waved to me upon the pier  
That's how we parted ways  
Your face was lost within the fog  
Missed in the sunken haze  

We fled that wretched haze my dear  
The lives that we had sold  
The hold jam packed with sunlit stone  
The sea so still and cold  

The sea's so very cold my dear  
My breath it's bound to take  
But colder still's the icy gaze  
That follows in our wake  

It follows as we wake my love  
And it dreams us while we sleep  
Its shadow haunts the lidless waves  
In silence walks the deep
