When you find it at last - maybe it was the wide-brimmed hat, or the skin-tight trousers or stylish shades.  The colors blend or clash, the posture swaggers.  The character is perfect; the attitude, presentation - everything has been distilled to what it should be.  That's the moment - when you should stop playing Saints Row 2.

You don't want them to find out the grim reality behind the cute fa√ßade of explosions and wacky cartoon violence.  You don't want to hurt them like that, to show that despite their flamboyance and style, they are doomed to a life of tedium and inertia.  And I don't just mean the car physics.  You've made your character stand out, be special and interesting in this world, but it's not going to catch up.  That first mission you played - shooting down endless low-level goons and a helicopter or two for variety - get ready to play it again, and again.  That's what you're here for.

I don't know if helicopters have ever been a welcome addition to a game, unless you get to be the one who gets inside and ruin other people's day.  But either way, it's time you tell them the score - this is their life.  Strip away the set dressing and you're playing the game of an office bureaucrat, sorting out problems like shredding documents or filing a form or two.  Maybe trade in the leather fetish gear for a sensible suit, while you're at it.  Might as well look the part.

Saints Row 2 is available on Steam for about $10, give or take.  Make a character, dress them up, cause a bit of chaos, then get massively disappointed by the actual content of most of the game.
