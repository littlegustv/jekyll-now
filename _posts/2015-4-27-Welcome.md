title: A New Website

A website must have content.  This does not happen overnight, so it seems inevitable to have some kind of starting point.  On it's own, it is almost nothing.  But taken with what is to come, hopefully it will point the direction to something worthwhile.  Though now that I think about it, who are you to judge, anyway?

On this page you'll find updates to the various games and programs I have in the works.  You might find bits of writing crossing all the possibilities of incomprehensibility.  I'll talk about philosophy, computer science, art, mathematics, or maybe nothing at all.  But it's good to have somewhere central, to bring it all back to.

Of course, since this is the first post, you likely have only stumbled upon it because there's already a great deal here, so you should know what to expect.  That's it, though, for now.
